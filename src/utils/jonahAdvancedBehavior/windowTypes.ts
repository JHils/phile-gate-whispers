 * Global Window Types for Jonah
 * 
 * This file extends the Window interface to add our custom properties.
 * It uses module augmentation to avoid conflicts with other declarations.
 * 
 * NOTE: Most global interface declarations have been consolidated in globalConsoleTypes.ts
 * This file is kept mainly for reference but doesn't declare new interfaces.
