The Gate was never meant to be opened from this side.\n\nRemember: The coin is the key. The bracelet is the lock. Your name is the spell that binds them.\n\nDon't trust what you remember. Don't trust what you see. And for God's sake, don't trust anyone who says they're me.\n\nI am the Monster, but I was never the villain.\n\nForget me if you must, but remember yourself.\n\n- M`,
