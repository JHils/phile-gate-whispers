            Jonah was a <TextGlitch originalText="traveller" glitchText="prisoner" />, 
            a <TextGlitch originalText="dreamer" glitchText="victim" />, and a man who fought against the 
            crumbling walls of his own <TextGlitch originalText="mind" glitchText="reality" />.

          <p className="mb-6">
            His journey began with the silver bracelet, a <TextGlitch originalText="gift" glitchText="curse" /> from 
            someone he thought he knew. The <TextGlitch originalText="coin" glitchText="key" /> came laterâ€”found 
            between the pages of a book he didn't remember buying.

          <p className="mb-6">
            The trip to Australia wasn't his idea. He'd tell you that if he could. But by then, 
            the <TextGlitch originalText="walls" glitchText="lies" /> were already closing in.

            Some say he's still searching for a way back. Others say he never left at all.
